They hoped he could help Helen.</p><p>After the doctor had tested Helen&rsquo;s eyes and ears he shook his head. &ldquo;Helen will always be blind and deaf,&rdquo; he told her parents. &ldquo;But she is very intelligent. She can learn. Perhaps Dr. Alexander Graham Bell can help you find someone to teach her.&rdquo;</p><p>The Kellers went to Washington to see Dr. Bell. He was famous as the inventor of the telephone. He had spent many years working to help deaf people.</p><p>Helen did not know why they made another visit. She did not know the kind man who held her on his knee. She touched his face and felt his gentle smile. He let Helen hold his watch against her cheek. She could feel it tick.</p><p>Dr. Bell told Captain Keller about a school for blind children in Boston, Massachusetts. It was called the Perkins Institute.</p><p>&ldquo;There was a girl named Laura Bridgman who was blind and deaf,&rdquo; Dr. Bell said. &ldquo;Dr. Howe at the Perkins school taught her to understand words by spelling with his fingers. He pressed the letters against her hand and showed her how to make each letter of the alphabet with her own fingers. Dr. Howe is dead. You must write to Dr. Anagnos at the Perkins School. Ask him to find a teacher who will help Helen.&rdquo;</p><p>After the journey home to Alabama, Helen lived in the same dark world again. Her mind was like a wild bird in a cage. She still flew into terrible tempers. She did not know that her mother and father were hoping that Dr. Anagnos could send a teacher for her.</p><p>Many months passed. Then one spring day Helen felt excitement in the house again. All day she grew more curious. She waited on the front porch until at last she felt the thud of the horse&rsquo;s hoofs in the drive. The carriage stopped. There was a thump as a heavy suitcase was set down.</p><p>Helen felt new footsteps coming toward her. Her curiosity was bursting. She rushed at the stranger and felt a young woman&rsquo;s arms go around her. Helen&rsquo;s finger flew over the new face and handbag.</p>",

She studied natural sciences.</p><p>In 1925, Kahlo was badly hurt in a bus accident. She had to spend a long time in bed to get better. While she was recovering, Kahlo spent her time painting. She had a special easel that allowed her to paint while she was lying down. A mirror was placed above her so she could paint pictures of herself. Kahlo would continue to make pictures of herself for the rest of her life. &ldquo;I paint myself because I am so often alone,&rdquo; she once said. &ldquo;I am the subject I know best.&rdquo;</p><p>By 1927, Kahlo had mostly recovered. She got involved in politics and joined the Mexican Communist Party. The communists believed that people should share things equally. They wanted to do away with the gap between the rich and the poor. Kahlo met several important communists, including the painter Diego Rivera. Rivera was famous for his murals. These were enormous paintings that he made directly on walls.</p><p>Kahlo celebrated her Mexican background in her paintings. She also started wearing traditional Mexican clothes, including colorful tops and long skirts.</p><p>In 1937, some of Kahlo's paintings were shown in Mexico. Important art collectors began to celebrate her work. She was eventually invited to show her paintings in New York. In the United States, she was widely praised for her bold paintings and fashion style.</p><p>In her final years, her health got worse and she became very sad. Still, she continued to paint. Kahlo died on July 13, 1954, at the age of 47, and her fame continues to grow. She is now recognized as one of Mexico's greatest artists and is known around the world for her bold paintings.</p>",
